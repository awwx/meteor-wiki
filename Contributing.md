# Contributing code to the Meteor project

The best way (the only way?) to contribute code is to submit a pull request.  We have a few guidelines for you.

* Development happens on the **devel** branch, so please make sure your branch is based off that.
* Sign the [contributor's agreement](http://contribute.meteor.com/).
* Follow the [Meteor coding standards](StyleGuide).

If you're working on a big ticket item, best to check in first on the #meteor IRC channel or email us at contact@meteor.com.  We'd hate to have to steer you in a different direction after you've already put in a lot of hard work.
