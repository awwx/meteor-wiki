This explains the various labels that we use in the issue tracker.

## unconfirmed-bug
Needs more information. Eg, a way to replicate, more details on observed behavior, etc.

## confirmed-bug
Known and confirmed behavior that should be changed.

## needs-docs
It's a known behavior that can be addressed through docs. Err on the side of this rather than "feature" whenever possible.

## feature
Addressing it would require feature work on someone's part.

## `<feature-name>`, e.g. "spark"
It will likely be resolved when that feature is released. 

## wont-fix
An issue that we've decided not to fix.  This is a last resort: see if "needs-docs" works before using this label.
